# Project Name

FEEDBACK FORM REMIX

## Description

A feedback form built using a SPA (Single Page Application) format to create pseudo pages for the form. Feel free to change up the questions to collect feedback for your particular event. The form allows for a selection between 1 and 5 and the final page includes a section for comments.

All data is collected on #/admin page.

##Prerequisites

Node.js
React.js
PostgreSQL

## Installation

1. Create a database named `feedback`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage

1. Load up the application and begin exploring!
2. There are buttons for navigation and drop down selections.
3. Manually change to #/admin to see the collected data!
